# A quick overview of machine learning jargon

## Supervised Machine Learning

In a supervised case, the technique knows the target it is trying to move towards.

There are two main categories:
 * Regression - labels are continuous. E.g. predicting house prices based on factors of house.
 * Classification - labels are discrete. E.g. identifying species of flower from petal measurements.

### Example of supervised learning process

 1. Collect x (input) data. For example, the number of rooms in a house, the size of the garden, the location etc.
 2. Measure y (target) data. For example, the price of the house.
 3. Choose a model and then train it on the collected data.
 4. Make predictions on new data using trained model.

## Unsupervised Machine Learning

In the unsupervised case, the technique does not know the final target, but simply tries to find patterns in the data.7

There are two main categories:
 * Clustering
 * Dimensionality reduction
